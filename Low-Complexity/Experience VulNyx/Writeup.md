---

## ℹ️ Information

The Experience machine exposes SMB services running on an unpatched Windows XP system. This configuration is vulnerable to `MS08-067 (CVE-2008-4250)`, a critical remote code execution flaw in the Windows Server service (NetAPI).

By sending a specially crafted RPC request over SMB port, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Successful exploitation results in full compromise of the target system, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## 📚 Scope & Methodology

The assessment was conducted following a structured approach, dividing the process into the following phases:

1. Controlled active reconnaissance  
2. Targeted enumeration of identified services  
3. Validation of known vulnerabilities  
4. Minimization of unnecessary noise during testing

---

## 🔍 Reconnaissance

As an initial step, a local network discovery scan was performed using `arp-scan` to identify active hosts within the same subnet.

```bash
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet
```

![01](Screenshots/1.png)

This command sends ARP requests across the local network segment in order to detect live hosts responding at Layer 2. Unlike traditional ICMP-based discovery, ARP scanning is more reliable within local networks because it does not depend on firewall rules blocking ICMP traffic.

The scan identified an active host at:

- 192.168.1.139

- MAC Address: 08:00:27:1f:35:50

The MAC address prefix `08:00:27` is commonly associated with VirtualBox virtual machines. In this case, this aligns with the lab setup, as the vulnerable environment is intentionally virtualized for proof-of-concept (PoC) testing.

</div>

An ICMP echo request was sent to confirm host availability and network reachability.
The response confirmed that the target was alive, with a TTL value of 128, suggesting a Windows-based operating system.

This confirmed the presence of the target machine within the local network and provided the IP address required for further enumeration.

---

## 🔎 Enumeration

After confirming that the target host was alive and reachable, a port scan was conducted using `Nmap` in order to identify exposed services and potential attack vectors.

The scan included default NSE scripts to gather additional service information and perform basic vulnerability checks.

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -sS -sC -sV --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn TargetIP
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/3.png" alt="Ping Result" width="900">
</div>

The results revealed ports `135 (MSRPC)`, `139 (NetBIOS)`, and `445 (SMB)` open, indicating a Windows-based host exposing file-sharing services.

Service fingerprinting pointed to Windows XP as the underlying operating system. The SMB configuration showed message signing disabled and failed SMBv2 negotiation, both consistent with an outdated and potentially vulnerable setup.

Although `Nmap` provided strong indicators about the operating system and SMB configuration, additional SMB enumeration was performed using netexec to validate these findings.

The results from `netexec` confirmed the system was running Windows 5.1 x32 (Windows XP), with SMBv1 enabled and SMB signing disabled. These findings align with the initial `Nmap` enumeration and provide a reliable understanding of the target’s SMB configuration.

## 🔬 Vulnerability Assessment

With the operating system and SMB configuration verified, vulnerability-specific NSE scripts will be used to evaluate known vulnerabilities affecting the SMB service.

```bash
sudo nmap -p445 --script=vuln TargetIP
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/6.png" alt="06" width="700">
</p>

The scan results indicate that the target is vulnerable to both `MS08-067 (CVE-2008-4250)` and `MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0143)`, two critical remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting the SMB service.

</p>


`MS08-067` impacts the Windows Server service (NetAPI), allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted RPC request.

`MS17-010` targets the SMBv1 protocol and was widely exploited in large-scale attacks such as WannaCry.

---

## 💥 Exploitation

In order to exploit the confirmed vulnerabilities in the Windows XP environment, `MS08-067` was selected as the primary attack vector.

The `Metasploit Framework` will be used due to its extensive collection of preloaded modules and its flexibility for configuring target-specific parameters. The process will begin by locating the appropriate module, setting the necessary options, and then executing the exploit in a controlled and systematic manner to ensure precise results.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/8.png" width="600">
</p>

The initial step in the exploitation process is to locate and prepare the `MS08-067` module within the `Metasploit Framework` for configuration and execution.

</p>

After locating the module, the configuration phase begins. For this proof of concept, only the `RHOSTS` parameter needs to be set in order to define the target IP address, while the remaining options are left with their default values.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/10.png" width="1100">
</p>

The command `set RHOSTS 192.168.1.139` is used to define the target system. The IP address 192.168.1.139 corresponds to the Windows XP host previously identified during network enumeration as vulnerable to `MS08-067`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/11.png" width="800">
</p>

Once the `RHOSTS` parameter is configured, the module is executed using the `run` command. This initiates the exploitation process against the specified target system.

<p align="center">

</p>

The module executed successfully, resulting in the establishment of a Meterpreter session. Using the `shell` command, an interactive command prompt was obtained on the target system, demonstrating full command execution capabilities.

At this stage, full access to the system has been achieved. Further exploration of the file system can be performed to locate sensitive files, such as user.txt and root.txt, demonstrating the potential impact of a successful compromise.

## 🧾 Conclusion

The exploitation of MS08-067 successfully demonstrated that the Windows XP system is critically vulnerable to remote code execution. By leveraging the Metasploit Framework, full system access was obtained without authentication, confirming the severity of the identified vulnerability.

This assessment highlights the risks associated with legacy operating systems and outdated SMB configurations, particularly when security patches are not applied. The presence of exploitable services exposed over the network significantly increases the attack surface and enables complete system compromise.

Proper patch management, disabling legacy protocols such as SMBv1, and restricting unnecessary network exposure are essential measures to prevent similar exploitation scenarios.
